# RoboND-SLAMLab
In this lab, youâ€™ll implement a gmapping ROS package which is based on the Grid-based FastSLAM algorithm to map an environment.

### Steps to launch the simulation
Launch the simulation in the VM machine provided in Term1. 

#### Step 1 Create a catkin workspace
Skipt this step if you already have a workspace
```sh
$ mkdir -p /home/workspace/catkin_ws/src
$ cd catkin_ws/src/
$ catkin_init_workspace
$ cd ..
$ catkin_make
```

#### Step 2 Perform a system update/upgrade
```sh
$ apt-get update
$ apt-get upgrade -y
```

#### Step 3 Clone the package in src
```sh
$ cd /home/workspace/catkin_ws/src
$ git clone https://github.com/udacity/RoboND-SLAMLab
```

#### Step 4 Build and source your workspace
```sh
$ cd ..
$ catkin_make
$ source devel/setup.bash
```

#### Step 5 Launch the nodes
```sh
$ cd src/RoboND-SLAMLab
$ ./SLAM.sh
```
Now, you should see Gazebo and rviz launching.

### End Result
In the terminal, use the keyboard commands(u-i-o-j-k-l-m-,-.) and drive the robot around. You'll see a map of the environment in Rviz!

## Gazebo World Segment<br/>
Gazebo is a useful simulation tool that can be used with ROS to render robots in a simulated environment. It comes with a model and world editor, along with presets, that can allow for quick prototyping of an environment. 

The main principles taught in this segment are: 
1) Using model editor tool to render a robot with specified links & joints
2) Using World editor tool to render an environment (e.g. a house)
3) Running plugins on launch of Gazebo platform


## ROS Essentials Segment<br/>
Robot Operating System is a middleware designed for communication between different robotic parts, as well as common useful packages that can be used for robotic applications.

The main principles taught in this segment are: 
1) Packages & Catkin Workspaces
2) Writing ROS nodes & communication models

## Localization Segment<br/>
2 common localization principles are the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and the Monte Carlos Localization (Particle Filter). Given a map of the surrounding and motor controls, the robot can use either of these principles to estimate its state position.

The main principles taught in this segment are: 
1) Extended Kalman Filter
2) Monte Carlos Localization (Particle Filter)
